# LP Templates

## Overview
Below are the Intro and Outro screens seen at the beginning and end of each lesson. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with the contents of these screens before filling out the template.

### Intro Screens
Content in your template mimics the order the Data Entry person will generate JSON, and not necessarily the order of the content from top to bottom. Please refer to the numbered list below for more explanation.
